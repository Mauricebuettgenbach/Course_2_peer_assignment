    "_I am an analyst for corporate data in the real asset finance industry. The industry is compared to the financial asset world still in the stone ages - most things are based on Excel. As this requires an extremely high amount of manual work, I have started to teach myself programming languages to automize parts of my job. And what can I tell you? I kind of fell in love with it. So here I am now, trying to learn as much as I can about data science to make the most out of my two passions: real asset finance and programming._"
